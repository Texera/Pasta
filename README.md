<h1 align="center">Pasta: A Cost-Based Optimizer for Generating Pipelining Schedules for Dataflow DAGs</h1>


This repo contains the source code and data for Pasta ([SIGMOD'25 Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698832)).

<img src="core/gui/src/assets/logos/full_logo_small.png" alt="texera-logo" width="25px" height="50px"/> Pasta is built on top of Apache Texera (Incubating), a collaborative data analytics workflow system.

The experiments in the paper were performed on a branch of Texera in July 2024. Since then the Pasta scheduler has been fully integrated into Texera's master and we have moved the additional source code related to running Pasta's experiments to this repo (forked from Texera on August 2025).

# Running Experiments

## Setting up Texera

Follow https://github.com/apache/texera/wiki/Guide-for-Developers to setup a dev environment for Texera and run the backend micro services in IntelliJ. For the step of "Clone and Configure Texera", use this link instead:

```
git clone git@github.com:Texera/pasta.git
```

## Running Experiments Related to Goal 1: Minimizing Total Sizes of Materialization

All the workflows we used for analyses and running experiments on the optimization goal of minimizing total sizes of materialization are in the following file:

```
/pasta_experiment_inputs/wallclock_runtime_experiment_workflows.zip
```

Extract this file in the same directory. It contains ~6K real-world workflows as Texera workflow source files. Note the workflows are only used for analysis and simulating scheduling optimization on the goal of reducing materialzation sizes, and will not be executable in Texera.

To run a complete set of experiments for Goal 1, navigate to this file in Intellij:

```
core/amber/src/main/scala/edu/uci/ics/texera/workflow/PastaMatSizeOptimizationExperimentRunner.scala
```

Execute `PastaMatSizeOptimizationExperimentRunner` in Intellij and provide 3 CLI arguments to this binary:

`<input_file> <output_directory> <results_file>`

- <input_file>: The path to the source of a workflow, e.g., `".../pasta_experiment_inputs/mat_size_experiment_workflows/_01_ChemicalLibraryEnumeration.json"`
- <output_directory>: Your desired path to the additional output files to be generated by the experiment runner. These will be images of the input physical plan and region plans of each method.
- <results_file>: Your desired path of the result CSV file. The complete statistics about the input workflow and the performance of each method on this workflow will be written to this CSV file.

## Running Experiments Related to Goal 2: Minimizing Workflow Wall-clock Runtime

The workflows and their input files of this goal can be found in 

```
/pasta_experiment_inputs/mat_size_experiment_workflows.zip
```

Extract this file in the same directory.

This step requires running Texera.
